# Overview
## Project Description

This project is a Discord bot that is modeled after the popular board game Battleship. The bot will allow a single
 user to play against it in a game of Battleship. The bot is responsible for placing three ships varying in length
 on a 7x7 grid and allowing the user to guess the location of the ships using a coordinate on the grid. The bot will
 respond with a hit or miss message and will keep track of the user's past moves and ships sunk.

## Usage

The user can interact with the bot by sending messages in the Discord chat.
The following commands are viable for the bot to respond to:<br>
`!playbattleship` - Starts the game of battleship. <br>
`!endgame` - Ends a current game of battleship. <br>
`!status` -  Displays the current status of the game (Moves remaining and ships left to sink). <br>
`!help`  -  Displays a list of commands that the bot will respond to. <br>
